                    Belgium is entering a decisive phase in its digital transformation, driven by the broader European
                    effort to create a unified, efficient and transparent invoicing ecosystem. Structured electronic
                    invoicing will soon become the default format for business-to-business transactions. This change has
                    major implications for how companies generate invoices, exchange documents and maintain VAT
                    compliance.

                    The rules governing this new system are precise and highly technical, which is why understanding the
                    regulatory expectations early is essential. The following guide breaks down the technical
                    requirements, formats and standards that apply under Belgium's e-invoicing framework, and
                    explains how businesses can prepare for the transition.

                    Belgium's e-invoicing framework is built around three core technical principles. These

                <T>
                    The origin of the invoice must always be identifiable. Both supplier and customer share
                    responsibility for ensuring that the invoice genuinely originates from the correct issuer. This
                    requirement helps prevent fraudulent invoices and strengthens VAT control.

                    Once issued, the invoice must remain unaltered. If a correction or amendment is required, it must be
                    made through a separate structured document that references the original invoice. This requirement
                    preserves the reliability of the financial record.

                    Belgium's e-invoicing reform represents one of the most significant modernisations of the
                    country's financial and VAT infrastructure. The shift to structured invoicing, enforced through
                    Peppol BIS and EN 16931, is designed to eliminate manual inefficiencies, improve VAT oversight and
                    support cross-border interoperability across Europe. Preparing early is essential. This includes
                    upgrading accounting systems, ensuring software compatibility, training teams and establishing
                    internal processes that support structured invoicing.

                    As businesses make this transition, many find that dedicated platforms simplify the journey.
                    Solutions such as Accqrate help companies adopt structured invoicing with confidence by supporting
                    the required formats, enabling Peppol connectivity and strengthening compliance workflows in a
                    straightforward and reliable way.
