          In December 2021, the Zakat, Tax, and Customs Authority (ZATCA) of the
          Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) implemented phase 1 of its e-invoicing
          system. The next stage, phase 2, is being rolled out in waves. From
          January 1, 2023, the first group of taxpayers whose turnover exceeded
          SAR 3 billion in 2021 must comply with the system. Meanwhile, the
          second group, consisting of businesses in KSA with a turnover of more
          than SAR 500 million and less than SAR 3 billion, must integrate their
          ERP/POS with ZATCA’s Fatoora portal starting July 1, 2023. However,
          non-residents for VAT purposes are not part of the initiative.

          To comply with the ZATCA e-invoicing phase 2 requirements, Saudi
          Arabian businesses need to make specific changes to their existing
          processes. This article aims to guide the necessary adjustments.
          Ideally, taxpayers should make minimal changes to their existing
          business processes to implement e-invoicing. Here are the changes
          required to comply with e-invoicing regulations:

          Minor changes are required to the invoice data capturing process to
          convert regular invoices into e-Invoices as per the ZATCA
          requirements, but businesses can continue with their existing
          invoicing process. Key fields are:

            Phase 1 is quite simple, and businesses can easily create the
            invoice in the compliance format, even in Excel or a Word
            document, and use a QR Code generator and paste the image.
            However, phase 2 cannot be managed without a software integrator
            with ZATCA.

            Fatoora registration: Register your company and get the OTP. Be
            ready with the VAT number and CR number before registration. For
            testing purposes, only register in the Simulation instance
            provided in Fatoora.
          </T>
        </li>
        <li>
          <T>
            Device registration: Devices should be added and registered with
            ZATCA as per the business structure to ensure seamless
            functioning. If you are using multiple companies or systems, each
            should be registered as a device.
          </T>
        </li>
        <li>
          <T>
            CSID Generation: Generate your certificates and private and public
            key. This needs technical assistance and cannot be done with
            software development knowledge.

        </li>
        <li>
          <T>
            ZATCA XML generation: ZATCA has provided an XML format in which
            data should be exchanged with ZATCA servers. It includes
            additional information like digital signatures, previous hash,
            security certificates, invoice hashing, etc.
          </T>
        </li>

        <li>
          <T>
            Invoice fields: It should be mapped with the UBL 2.1 schema, and
            any missing fields should be added to comply with ZATCA
            requirements, even though businesses may currently have their
            invoice format.
          </T>
        </li>
        <li>
          <T>
            Invoice transmission to ZATCA: There are multiple ways to send the
            compliant XML to ZATCA. You could use SDKs provided by ZATCA or
            Web Services.
          </T>
        </li>
        <li>
          <T>
            PDF generation: There is a common misconception that PDFs should
            be sent in phase 2. However, there is no need to send PDFs to
            ZATCA. ZATCA only accepts XML for phase 2 and returns the XML with
            a signature and QR code. After receiving XML approval from ZATCA,
            businesses can continue to send their PDFs to their customers.

        </li>
        <li>
          <T>
            Invoice transmission time: Tax invoices should be sent to ZATCA in
            real time. This means that as soon as an invoice is generated, it
            should be validated and approved by ZATCA. Simplified invoices
            must be sent within 24 hours from the invoice to the
            customer/consumer.
          </T>
        </li>
        <li>
          <T>
            Invoice sharing with customers: Based on the e-invoice issued,
            businesses may need to upgrade their invoice-sharing process. For
            B2B transactions, businesses must share a soft copy of a valid
            standard tax e-invoice in PDF/A-3 format. For B2C transactions, a
            physical copy of the simplified tax e-invoice with a valid QR code
            must be shared.
          </T>
        </li>
        <li>
          <T>
            Archival of invoice data: The archival facility should be
            implemented to store invoices for at least 6 years, as specified
            by ZATCA, for any audit or reconciliation requirements.
          </T>

          Businesses need to comply with these requirements to avoid penalties
          or legal action. Accqrate e-invoicing solution can be used to generate
          e-invoices compliant with ZATCA phase 2 in just two clicks. Phase 2
          can be a complex procedure, but Accqrate e-invoicing middleware
          simplifies the process, allowing businesses to concentrate on their
          core operations without any worries.
