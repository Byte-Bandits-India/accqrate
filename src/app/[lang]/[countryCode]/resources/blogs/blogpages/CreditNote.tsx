            also known as a credit memo, plays a pivotal role in business financial transactions. It signifies
            the return of funds to a company under various circumstances such as invoice errors, the receipt
            of incorrect or damaged products, or the cancellation of a purchase order. Credit notes can be
            issued for the full invoice amount or a partial sum. Not only do they adjust your account
            receivables, but they also rectify the taxes associated with the invoices. It’s essential to note
            that the credited sum should not surpass the invoice’s total gross amount.

        <li>
          <T>
            To rectify invoice errors. For instance, if the invoice amount is overstated or the correct
            discount has not been applied.
          </T>
        </li>
        <li>
          <T>
            To cancel outstanding payments on an invoice. When companies anticipate a customer would not
            settle an invoice, they often produce a credit note to sidestep related taxations or VAT.
          </T>
        </li>
        <li>
          <T>
            To refund payments made against an invoice, especially when products malfunction within the
            warranty period.

        <T>Illustrating Credit Note Integration with ZATCA</T>
      </h4>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-fluid-small leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <T>Below illustrates a scenario where a buyer procures products worth:</T>
        <br />
        <T>Net amount - 10,000 SAR</T> <br />
        <T>VAT amount - 1,500 SAR</T> <br />
        <T>Gross amount - 11,500 SAR</T> <br />
        <br />
        <T>
          The seller must get the invoice approved by ZATCA before dispatching it to the buyer. This process
          results in a VAT of 1,500 SAR, payable to ZATCA.
        </T>
        <br />
        <br />
        <T>
          Suppose, weeks later, the buyer decides to return the products due to defects. They assert that 20%
          of the goods are flawed and request a refund. Given the seller has already processed the invoice
          with ZATCA, a credit note for the 20% refund becomes imperative.
        </T>
        <br />
        <br />
        <T>The seller’s credit note details would be:</T>
        <br />
        <T>Net amount - 2,000 SAR</T> <br />
        <T>VAT amount - 300 SAR</T> <br />
        <T>Gross amount - 2,300 SAR</T> <br />
        <br />
        <T>
          Upon sending this credit note to ZATCA, referencing the original invoice, the new VAT payable
          becomes 1,200 SAR (1,500 – 300 = 1,200 SAR).
