        <T>
          The Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority (ZATCA) re-launched an initiative to cancel fines and exempt
          financial penalties imposed on taxpayers for six months, beginning on <b>June 1, 2022</b>, and
          ending on <b>November 30, 2022</b>. This program was introduced to mitigate the financial strain on
          businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
        </T>
      </p>

      <p className="story text-fluid-small leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
        <T>
          <b>Note (Updated)</b>: While the exemption period mentioned above ended on November 30, 2022, ZATCA
          has periodically introduced and extended certain programs to support taxpayers. As of the latest
          press releases in 2023 and 2024, there have been <b>no further blanket extensions</b> of this
          specific exemption initiative. However, ZATCA continues to announce targeted relief measures on a
          case-by-case basis. Taxpayers are advised to regularly monitor official ZATCA announcements for any
          new or upcoming relief programs.
