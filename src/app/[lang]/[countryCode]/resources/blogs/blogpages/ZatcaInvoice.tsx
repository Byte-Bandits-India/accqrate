        <T>1. E-invoices that comply with ZATCA requirements:</T>
      </p>
      <p className="story text-fluid-small mb-4">
        <T>
          For Phase I, the e-invoicing software that you select should comply
          with ZATCA guidelines, including the generation of QR codes and
          automatic invoice archiving. For Phase II, the e-invoicing software
          should seamlessly integrate with ZATCA’s system to send your invoices.
          This means the software should be a cloud-based solution built on
          modern technology to adapt and scale for future needs.

        <T>2. Integrate with all your business functions:</T>
      </p>
      <p className="story text-fluid-small mb-4">
        <T>
          When selecting e-invoice software for your business in Saudi Arabia,
          ensure that it is flexible and easily integrates with your other
          business functions such as Sales, Purchase, Marketing, and HR. This
          integration enables seamless transitions to any ERP process in the
          future, supporting growth without major cost implications.
        </T>
      </p>

      <p className="story text-fluid-body font-semibold mb-4">
        <T>3. Easy to integrate with existing applications:</T>
      </p>
      <p className="story text-fluid-small mb-4">
        <T>
          The e-invoice software should easily integrate with your current
          accounting software or any other systems handling accounting, VAT,
          inventory, payroll, etc., without much trouble. This will lead to
          better collaboration across your business processes, especially as
          your accounts payable focuses on efficient invoice processing.

      <p className="story text-fluid-body font-semibold mb-4">
        <T>4. Simple to deploy:</T>
      </p>
      <p className="story text-fluid-small mb-4">
        <T>
          Choose e-invoicing software that can be deployed in just 4–5 simple
          steps to get the final invoice output. The provider should work
          closely with you on a detailed rollout plan and ensure comprehensive
          training is available for smooth adoption.

        <T>5. Pricing:</T>
      </p>
      <p className="story text-fluid-small mb-4">
        <T>
          Pricing is a key factor that can make or break an agreement. It’s
          essential to carefully review the pricing structure of the
          e-invoicing solution to ensure it aligns with the scale of your
          business. Small business owners generating five or fewer invoices per
          month might even consider free e-invoicing software providers.
