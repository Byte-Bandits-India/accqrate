                    Belgium is preparing for one of the most important financial digitization shifts in its history.
                    Starting January 2026, most business-to-business transactions will require structured electronic
                    invoices. This move brings Belgium in line with the broader European vision for real-time digital
                    reporting, secure tax administration and automated financial processes.

                    E-invoicing in Belgium goes far beyond sending PDF files by email. It involves exchanging invoices
                    in a structured format that can be interpreted and processed directly by software. The country
                    relies on the Peppol network and the European EN16931 standard to ensure invoices can be validated,
                    routed and processed without manual intervention.

                    E-invoicing refers to issuing, sending, receiving and processing invoices in a structured digital
                    format. In Belgium, structured invoices typically follow the European EN16931 standard and are
                    exchanged through Peppol-compatible software. This ensures machine readability and automation
                    throughout the entire invoice lifecycle.

                    At a minimum, companies should review their invoicing systems, select Peppol-compatible software,

                    Belgium&apos;s transition to structured e-invoicing represents an important shift toward a more
                    transparent, secure and efficient financial ecosystem. Businesses that prepare early will be better
                    positioned to comply with the mandate, reduce administrative effort and integrate smoothly with the
                    broader European digital framework. Many organisations are choosing platforms that simplify
                    structured invoicing, validation and Peppol connectivity. Solutions such as Accqrate, which already
                    support automated and compliant e-invoicing workflows, can help companies adapt with confidence
                    while they modernise their financial operations.
